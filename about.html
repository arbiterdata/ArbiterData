                <p>Arbiter Data is a company which prides itself on its ability to explain technology without resorting to baffling jargon. And to explain what our business is about we can use an aviation analogy.
                  <br>
                  <h2>The analogy</h2>
                  <img src="assets/gifs/harrier.gif">
                  <br>
                  <strong>The Harrier</strong>. The first vertical take off and landing jet plane. It combined the best in jet planes and helicopters and it inspires how we use computers for our customers.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  At Arbiter Data we build the business equivalents of Harrier jump jets.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Helicopters and Fighter Jets</h3>
                  Helicopters can take off and land anywhere making them remarkably flexible. However they can't fly very fast, so they take a long time to get to the frontline. And their slowness leaves them vulnerable to ground attacks. And to make matters worse they have a tendency to crash.
                  <br>
                  <br>By comparison the fighter jet can travel faster than the speed of sound, deploy devastating precision weaponry and is invulnerable to all but the most sophisticated ground attacks.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <img class="centre_img" src="assets/gifs/giphy.gif">
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  However jets require long run ways and sophisticated infrastructure to get them in the air.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  At Arbiter Data we see the trade offs between the helicopter and the fighter jet as being analogous to the trade offs businesses make in relation to their data and IT. And at Arbiter Data we see computer programs as similar to fighter jets. They are incredibly fast, precise and powerful.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Most organisations want to utilise computer programs as they can see the potential. But they find they can't because their infrastructure doesn't allow them to. This is analogous to not having a run way long enough to launch a fighter jet.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  So instead most organisations resort to the much cheaper and easier to deploy helicopter equivalent:
                  <br>
                  <h3>the spreadsheet!</h3>
                  At Arbiter Data we love spreadsheets. We started off as accountants after all. We love how flexible they are. We love easy they are to use. We love how cheap they are. However spreadsheets are used for lots of jobs they really aren't appropriate for.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Anybody who has some experience in business will no doubt have come across spreadsheets with:
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>tab after tab after a tab of data -> sort of like a helicopter travelling a long distance it can't cover quickly because it is slow</li>
                    <li>confusing forumulas that probably don't work -> sort of like a helicopter flailing around in a cross wind</li>
                    <li>incorrect or out of date information -> sort of like a helicopter being shot down down by stray bullets</li>
                  </ul>
                  These dodgy spreadsheets cause a huge amount of unquantifiable damage to business in the form of time being wasted in preparing the spreadsheet, which is inevitably out of date by the time it is finished, and the confusion caused by the unreliable information contained in the spreadsheet.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <h3>What we do</h3>
                  At Arbiter Data we allow businesses to upgrade from spreadsheets to computer programs without requiring them to have the vast infrastucture typically associated with computer programs; in the same way the Harrier allows small military forces to upgrade from the helicopter to the fighter jet without needing a big aircraft carrier.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Or, to put it another way.
